#Tutorial: Configuring Illumina Adapter Sequences and Tags for New Samples

>This tutorial will guide you through the process of configuring Illumina adapter sequences and tags for new samples, based on a provided example configuration.

Understanding the Configuration File
The configuration file consists of several sections:

#Adapters: Sequences used in preparing the Illumina library.
#Tag Sequences: Unique sequences assigned to each sample for multiplexing.
#Tag Map: Mapping of samples to their corresponding tag sequences.
#Names: Readable names for each sample.

Configuration Example

Adapters

i7: GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC*ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG
i5: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC*ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT
The i7 and i5 sequences include the bases used in sequencing followed by a * and a sequence to be completed with the sample-specific tag.

Tag Sequences

i7_P001_WA01:GTGTTCTA
i7_P001_WA02:AGTCACTA
...
I5_P002_W_AB:CTTCGCCT
I5_P002_W_A0:TAAGATTA
Each tag is assigned an identifier (e.g. i7_P001_WA01) and a string (e.g. GTGTTCTA).

Tag Map

Homo_sapiens_GTGTTCTA:i7_P001_WA01,I5_P002_W_AB
Pantera_pantera_AGTCACTA:i7_P001_WA02,I5_P002_W_AB
...
This section maps each sample to its corresponding i7 and i5 tags.

Names

Homo_sapiens:Homo_sapiens
Pantera_pantera_AGTCACTA:Pantera_pantera
...
This section provides human-readable names for each sample.

Creating a New Configuration
To create a new configuration, follow these steps:

Prepare Adapter Sequences: Make sure you have the adapter sequences needed for your experiment. These are usually provided by the kit manufacturer.
Generate Tag Sequences: Create unique tag sequences for each of your samples. Make sure these sequences are unique to avoid cross-sample contamination.
Map Tags to Samples: Create a mapping of your samples to the i7 and i5 tags.
Assign Names: Assign human-readable names to your samples.

Example
Assuming you have the following new samples and tag sequences:

New Tag Strings

i7_New1: TGCATCGA
i7_New2: GCTAGCTA
i5_New1: CGTAGCTA
i5_New2: TACTGATC

New Samples

Sample1: i7_New1, i5_New1
Sample2: i7_New2, i5_New2

Names

Sample1_TGCATCGA: Sample1
Sample2_GCTAGCTA: Sample2

[adapters]
i7: GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC*TGCATCGA
i5: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC*CGTAGCTA

[tag sequences]
i7_New1:TGCATCGA
i7_New2:GCTAGCTA
i5_New1:CGTAGCTA
i5_New2:TACTGATC

[tag map]
Sample1_TGCATCGA:i7_New1,i5_New1
Sample2_GCTAGCTA:i7_New2,i5_New2

[names]
Sample1_TGCATCGA:Sample1
Sample2_GCTAGCTA:Sample2

Steps to Create Your Configuration
Prepare Adapter Sequences: Make sure you have the sequences provided by the kit manufacturer.
Define Your Tag Sequences: Make sure each sequence is unique.
Map Each Sample to Its Tags: Create a logical mapping.
Assign Readable Names: Make sure each sample has a clear, descriptive name.

Summary
This tutorial explained how to understand an existing setup for Illumina processing and create a new setup with different sequences.
By following these steps, you can configure your samples for Illumina sequencing, ensuring that each sample is uniquely identified by its adapter sequences and tags.
